# Trackify (A Hackiethon 2021 project by At0m1c P0tat0s)

### Binary executable disclaimer:

This project contains a binary executable "smart companion", which is part of the
core functionalities of the app. The smart companion app will monitor your app usage
and screen time usage, nothing more. It will periodically send data back to the app server,
and a select few AV (Antivirus) has flagged it as a "Trojan". This is a **false alarm!**. The
source code for the executable (written in .NET Framework 4.7.2) is contained as part of the
repository. If you do not trust the public release on the website, you can manually compile
it yourself (but make sure to set the URL to the server URL), and it will work exactly the same way.

### Project description:

Trackify allows people to visualize and track their computer and app usage through
a smart companion. Users can also compare their usage to their history, to see if their
work time has increased

### Usage

Users will first need to create an account on the website. 

Then, head over to the stats page by clicking on the button or visiting [this](http://bowenfeng.pythonanywhere.com/stats/)

If not already, download the companion app by clicking the download button on
the top right hand corner.

On the smart companion app, log in using your username and password. Then simply
minimize the companion app and head back to the stats page.

After a minute, you should see your screen time and app usage updated.

Users can also set goals (which are time limits) for screen time and also individual
app time usage.

### Features

- Real time monitoring of screen time and app usage

- Ability to dynamically add/remove apps that are monitored from the website,
no need to restart the companion app
  
- Low profile companion app, hidden and low CPU/RAM usage.

- Ability to set limits, visualize data and see if limits has been reached
